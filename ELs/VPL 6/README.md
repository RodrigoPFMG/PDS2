# Exercise List - Word Frequency Counter (STL)

📌 **Description**  
This exercise aims to practice the use of **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)** containers and string manipulation.  
The task is to read a text file and print how many times each word appears in the text.  

Rules:  
- All words must be converted to **lowercase**.  
- Any character that is **not alphanumeric** should be treated as a word separator.  
- Numbers are considered part of words.  
- The output should list words in **alphabetical order**, followed by their frequency.  

---

## 🎯 Topics Practiced
- Using STL containers (e.g., `map`, `unordered_map`)  
- String manipulation and parsing  
- File input/output with streams  
- Iterating and sorting data  

---

## 📝 Instructions
- Read the name of a text file from standard input.  
- Process the file and count occurrences of each word according to the rules above.  
- Print each word in **alphabetical order**, followed by its count, one per line.  

### Example

**Input file (`teste.txt`):** 
Isso eh um teste! Teste eh o que isso eh! Nota 10!  

**Output:** 
10 1  
eh 3  
isso 2  
nota 1  
o 1  
que 1  
teste 2  
um 1

✅ **Goal:** By the end of this exercise, you should be able to **count word occurrences** and **use STL containers effectively** for string and text processing in C++.
