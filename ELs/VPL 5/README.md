# Exercise List - Linked List Reversal (Pointers)

📌 **Description**  
This exercise aims to practice **pointer manipulation** using a **Linked List (List ADT)**.  
Your task is to implement the method `void List::Inverte()` that **reverses the order of elements in a linked list** by modifying pointers.  

⚠️ Important:  
- You **cannot** just swap the data fields.  
- You **cannot** create new nodes or use auxiliary structures.  
- The reversal must be done by manipulating the node pointers directly.  

---

## 🎯 Topics Practiced
- Pointer manipulation in C++  
- Working with linked list nodes  
- Implementing methods in a custom ADT  
- Understanding memory references and object connections  

---

## 📝 Instructions
- Analyze the provided files: `list.hpp`, `list.cpp`, and `main.cpp`.  
- Implement the method `void List::Inverte()` in `list.cpp`.  
- Submit only the modified `list.cpp` file.  
- The program in `main.cpp` will test your method for correctness.  

---

✅ **Goal:** By the end of this exercise, you should be confident in **reversing a linked list using pointers** without auxiliary structures or node creation.
