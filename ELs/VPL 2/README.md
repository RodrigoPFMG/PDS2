# Exercise List - Pointers and Memory Manipulation

📌 **Description**  
This exercise aims to practice the use of **pointers**, **memory manipulation**, and **parameter passing** in C++.  
The tasks are organized in sequential steps, starting from variable and pointer declarations to more advanced concepts like pointer arithmetic, pointer to pointer, and passing arguments by value, reference, and pointer.  

---

## 🎯 Topics Practiced
- Pointer declaration and initialization  
- Memory addresses and dereferencing  
- Dynamic arrays and vector manipulation  
- Pointer arithmetic (`[]` notation vs. pointer/offset notation)  
- Passing parameters by:
  - Value  
  - Reference (`&`)  
  - Pointer (`*`)  
- Functions with mixed parameter passing  
- Basic pointer-to-pointer usage  

---

## 📝 Instructions
- Complete the code provided in **`main.cpp`** by writing the missing instructions where indicated.  
- Carefully follow the comments to implement each step in order.  
- Ensure that outputs are formatted correctly:
  - When printing multiple values on the same line, separate them with a **single space**.  
  - Do **not** add a space after the last element.  
  - Always end the output of each instruction with a **newline (`endl`)**.
